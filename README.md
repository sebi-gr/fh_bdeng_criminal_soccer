# Criminal Soccer
The goal of the project is to load and process various datasets from the soccer area and visualize the results. The project is a direct continuation of the Big Data Infrastructure project and to run and analyzed under Data Science aspects.
For this purpose web scraping, API requests, .csv-File handling, Kafka, Spark and data cleaning is used. Furthermore, the architecture is built in a way that all services and metadata are hosted and is therefore multiuser capable.

With our diagrams we want to analyze if there are correlations between the foul statistics of the players and the crime statistics and/or the gross domestic product (=Bruttoinlandsprodukt) of their countries of origin.
Additionally, some other interesting and relevant graphs about the datasets will be shown.
