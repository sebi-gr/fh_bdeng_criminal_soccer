# Criminal Soccer

The goal of the project is to load and process various datasets from the soccer area and visualize the results. The
project is to be run and analyzed under the Big Data aspect. For this purpose, relational and NoSQL databases were used,
as well as a MapReduce algorithm. Furthermore, the architecture is built in a way that all services and metadata are
hosted and is therefore multiuser capable.

With our diagrams we want to analyze if there are correlations between the foul statistics of the players and the crime
statistics of their countries of origin. Additionally, some other interesting and relevant graphs about the datasets
will be shown.
